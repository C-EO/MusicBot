# Seeking support?

We only use this issue tracker for bug reports, documentation changes, and feature requests. We are not able to provide general support or answer
questions in the form of Nitehub issues.

For general questions about the Music Bot project and case uses, please use the dedicated support channels in our Discord
server: https://discord.gg/BmPNx9jJHD

Any issues that don't directly involve a bug, documentation change, or a feature request will likely be closed and redirected.
