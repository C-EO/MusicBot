## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction

Thank you for using the Music Bot project!

The Music Bot is an open source Discord AI/Bot used for streaming music in a Discord server.

The Music Bot project is maintained by the [Imperial Bot Team](https://git.c-eo.repl.co/imperialbot).

As the Imperial Bot Team, we're committed to building a community that is welcoming and inclusive: an environment where people are encouraged to share ideas, treat each other with respect, and collaborate
towards the best solutions. To reinforce our commitment, we have adopted a slightly modified [Code of Conduct](https://git.c-eo.repl.co/imperialbot/musicbot/src/branch/main/docs/code_of_conduct.md) for the Music Bot project.

_**Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.**_

## <a name="issue-reporting"></a>Issue Reporting

Reports of flaws in the Music Bot project, including software bugs, errors
in the documentation, missing files in the tarball, suggested changes
or requests for new features, etc., can be filed using the project's [issue tracker](https://git.c-eo.repl.co/imperialbot/musicbot/issues).

**Note:** 

- _The project's issue system is publicly readable; however, you must have an account registered with Nitehub to create a new issue._

- _Before reporting an issue, please search to see if someone has filed a similar issue before. If there is already an open issue, please add a :+1: and/or leave a comment with additional information._

- _Due to a large ticket backlog, we are sometimes slow to respond, especially if a bug is cosmetic or if a suggestion is vague or low in priority, but we try our best at least to acknowledge legitimate bug reports within a week._


## <a name="pull-request-process"></a> Pull Request Process

Please feel free to open a pull request to contribute to this project.

Guidelines for pull requests:

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface; new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request to the `main` branch once you have the approval of one lead developer. If you don't have the permission to merge it, please request the reviewer to merge it for you.
